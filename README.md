# Tododay TODO APP

This is a simple TODO app built in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and other useful technologies. 
The app is fully functional and can be used on any platform. This started off as a project just to improve my skills in programming.
As well as improve my skills in React also. I had a lot of fun building this and decided to make it mainstream and live. 
Create an account and make good use out of the app. More features will come soon...
